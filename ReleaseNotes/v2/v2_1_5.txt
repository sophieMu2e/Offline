           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v2_1_5

1) March 7, 2013,

   Notes by brownd.  Split TrkPatRec into 4 modules to make it more
   and avoid code duplication.  Add data products for stereo hits, hit
   positions and hit flags.  Use stereo hits in the delta ray removal
   algorithm.  Retune.  Note that track reconstruction sequences
   must be modified in fcl.
