   The merge of G4 MT mode broke multi-stage mode.
   This commit fixes the problems that I can see.
   I have not done a full set of tests that it is working correctly.

   Mu2eG4/src/GenEventBroker.cc
     - The test for a non-empty GenParticleCollection
       is only done in MT mode, not sequential mode.
     - The new test also requires the the GenParticle
       input stash data product to be present.

   Mu2eG4/src/Mu2eG4_module.cc
     - About reseating the art::Ptr from a SimParticle
       to its coresponding GenParticle: this is now
       only done in MT mode and if and only iff the
       the GenParticleCollection is present.

   Mu2eG4/src/PrimaryGeneratorAction.cc
      - In sequential mode, permit the GenParticleCollection to be absent
      - If it is absent, set the local variable genParticles_ to nullptr

   It is not usable with MDC2018 files.

  merge triggerDev branch: this includes:
  -TrkStrawHit now references ComboHit instead of StrawHit class objects.  This reduces
  data duplication and improves trigger processing time.
  - Knock-on changes to some reco-level persistent classes
  - Change straw hit signal propagation time to use calibrated propagation velocity
  - straw-in-panel calibration parameters for t0, gain
  - panel t0 offsets
