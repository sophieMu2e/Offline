           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v6_1_0

   cetlib has been split into two packages
        cetlib
        cetlib_except

   This means that the following change is needed:
   #include "cetlib/exception.h”
    becomes
   #include "cetlib_except/exception.h”

   All packages that use cetlib_except had their link lists updated to
   add cetlib_except where needed.

   Any packages that no longer need cetlib in their link list
   should have it removed.  I have not done this carefully.

   The canvas package used to have two libraries:
      canvas_Utilities.so
      canvas_Persistency_Common.so

   It now only has canvas.so
   Link lists were updated accordingly
