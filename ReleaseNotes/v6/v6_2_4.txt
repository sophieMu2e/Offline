           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v6_2_4

6) 17 July 2017  dnbrow01
   Fix some of the hard-wired 10200. instances in modules with references
   to parameterset values.  Update geom_common_DOE_review_2017.txt with
   the necessary mu2e.detectorSystemZ0 = 10171 value.

5) 12 July 2017  dnbrow01
   Created the new directory UtilityModules to hold the modules and
   associated fcl files for the StepPointMC corrections from yesterday's
   notes.  Fleshed out the modules and config files.  Note that the
   output sections of the config files assume certain process names.
   These are names from standard jobs, so should be safe, but user beware!
   This has been tested on the files being used for a sensitivity update
   for the July 2017 DOE review.

4) 11 July 2017  dnbrow01
   Added 4 files to Sandbox based on Rob's 6 new files, mentioned
   in item (3) below.  These files implement Rob's tests, with specifics 
   that fix the tracker StepPointMCs.  Will need to be generalized and
   possibly moved to a more permanent location.

   Added 6 new files to Sandbox.  These are used to test a proposal
   to fix the existing files that were produced with the DetectorSystem
   z0 bug: https://mu2e-hnews.fnal.gov/HyperNews/Mu2e/get/Sim/343.html

   TrkDiag/test/ce.C
   Update the module label used as a TDirectory name to match the
   new conventions.

   Mu2eG4/geom/geom_common_current.txt
   The code does not respect the indended difference between the z0 of
   tracker center and the z0 of the origin of the detector system.  So
   these two items must have the same value.  Specfically, in
   Mu2eG4/geom/geom_common_current.txt the line:

     double mu2e.detectorSystemZ0 = 10171.;

   must match:

    double ttracker.z0 = 10171.0;

   from the included ttracker file.  For now this must be maintened by hand.

   The intention is that ttracker.z0 describes the nominal center of the ttracker
   whereas mu2e.detectorSystemZ0 describes the origin of a coordinate system in
   which the reco work is done.  When we do alignment on the tracker, its position
   and orientation can shift but the detector system should stay fixed. This
   distinction is not respected by the code so, for the time being, the two values
   must be the same.

   This changed fixes an problem introduced with commit d8b1d154 on June 6, 2017.
