   Improve selective overlaps checking for building, dirt, and 
   External Shielding.  Split ConstructMaterials to use two functions
   to eschew compiler complaint about too many variables in previous
   single function.  Add the trench cover for the DS, built by Aaron Hill.

5) edmonds 26 May 2017
   Added KalSeedFilter module which reduces the payload of persistent tracks

   Added KalSeedToTrkQualTree module, which can use these filtered persistant tracks

   Added a couple of FCL files as examples

4)  dnbrow01  24 May 2017
    Change name of Brass material to "BrassC360" to avoid confusion.
    modified:   Mu2eG4/src/ConstructMaterials.cc

3)  murat May 23 2017

    - modify Mu2eG4/src/constructTS.cc to have the beam flash tooth always 
      position on the upstream end of the TS3 collimators

    - commit optimized parameters of the beam flash 'tooth'

    - modified files: Mu2eG4/geom/studies/studyCOL3FlashBlock.txt
                      Mu2eG4/src/constructTS.cc

2)  dnbrow01  17 May 2017
    Make the flash mitigation test block(s) more flexible in specification.
    Now you can give length, offsets, and material.

    This is a combined note for commits made on May 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 16,
    2017.  The majority of these commits were directed at readiness for a
    major MARS simulation run.  The last commit is for a study of beam flash
    reduction.  Details below in reverse chronological order.

    May 16:
    Added an option to create a block along the bottom of the TS3 collimators.
    This is for use in studying flash-associated background mitigation.
    One can either use the new file below as the geometry file in their fcl,
    or make equivalent modifications in TransportSolenoid_v02.txt.

    May 12:
    Fixed another issue found in MARS test jobs:  the insulating vacuum 
    within the PS/TS/DS cryostats was actually air.  Fixed for PS and DS.
    Added more options for selective surface checks.
    Mu2eG4/src/constructDS.cc                 
    Mu2eG4/src/constructPS.cc                 
    Mu2eG4/src/constructTTrackerv3Detailed.cc 
    Mu2eG4/test/geom_SurfaceCheck_Select.txt  

    May 11:
    Fixed some issues that were missed in visual inspections of geometry in
    mu2e.gdml files, but were spotted after some MARS test jobs:  the mother 
    volume for calorimeter crates was solid Aluminum (instead of DS Vacuum) 
    and the VPSP and IFB were Iron rather than Stainless.

    Mu2eG4/geom/calorimeter_CsI.txt        
    Mu2eG4/src/constructDiskCalorimeter.cc 

    Added Bronze (C94300) definition and mad the tracker upstream support ring
    from this material rather than Brass.
    Mu2eG4/geom/ttracker_cd3_s4p2.txt
    Mu2eG4/src/ConstructMaterials.cc

    May 10:
    Added Brass (C36000) definition and made the tracker upstream support ring
    from this material rather than Al.

    Mu2eG4/src/ConstructMaterials.cc 

    Per request, moved the wedge portion of the TS3 antiproton stopping
    window downstream by an amount controllable by text parameter.
    Default set to 3 mm.  The separation is a current design preference, 
    though not finalized.

    Fix overlaps caused by previous day's extension of the cable runs into
    the Calorimeter area.  Unfortunately causes some gaps in the cable run,
    but best we can do on limited time.
    Mu2eG4/src/constructDiskCalorimeter.cc


    May 9:
    Made a more continuous set of cable runs from the downstream DSVacuum 
    area into the Calorimeter area.  Also added some more options for 
    selective overlaps checking.

    numbers in the design plans.

    construction update.

    May 8:
    Making sure dirt and backfill fit around recent civil construction 
    updates, and filling some gaps left by mods.  Make geom_common_current
    point to all recent changes and put in comments on how to separate off
    the civil construction changes from the rest of the changes.
