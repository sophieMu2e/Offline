  - This release is in preparation for a 6-parameter track fit, including
  - Follow improvements to BTrk
  - Create a calorimeter cluster based 'hit' that can be included in a Kalman track fit
  - Improve the t0 calculation, in particular the particle transit time is now integrated along the track instead of assuming a constant beta
  - Allow assuming a different value of 'beta' from 1.0 when creating time clusters used in the pattern recognition
