      Alignment system is now functioning code.  Compiles, links, runs,
      does reasonable things.  Still needs detector system input
      for details.  Also needs collaboration decision for time handling.

      Flesh out more of the Alignment tools.  Compiles, links, runs.
      Currently just prints out alignment parameters.

3)    dnbrow01  13 October 2017
      Update the model of the wedge portion of the TS3 pbar absorber
      to reflect the most likely    way it will be constructed -	strips
      of Beryllium arranged as steps.	   This is not yet part of the
      default	     geometry, but will be pulled in   with geom_common_current

      Reorganized the	text to	be more	intuitive, I think.
      modified:   Mu2eG4/test/geom_SurfaceCheck_Select.txt

2)    dnbrow01  04 October 2017
      Eliminate use of Mu2eG4/test/geom_01.txt in favor of 
      Mu2eG4/geom/geom_common.txt.  Since Mu2eG4/test/geom_01.txt
      has long simply been a pointer to Mu2eG4/geom/geom_common.txt,
      this is not a functional change - just a cleanup to hopefully
      avoid confusion down the road.

        Polycone class definition had apparently originally been designed
	to hold all the information necessary to describe it as indiviual
	data elements.  Later is was migrated to hold the same information
	in a single PolyconsParams object.  But the original, now unused,
	data elements were still being carried around.  They are now 
	deleted.      
	modified:   GeomPrimitives/inc/Polycone.hh 


	Created an OPA version number.  Version number 1 builds the OPA
	as done in the past - as a conical frustrum.  Version 2 builds it
	as a "barrel" of slats.  The shape is called a G4Polyhedra in GEANT4
	(yes, they use the plural even for one).  We create a corresponding
	shape representation in Mu2e code, independent of G4.  Since 
	G4Polyhedra have been rare in our code to date, made some new 
	utility functions to help with inserting them into our Geometry
	model, now that they are being used more prominently in Mu2e.

	pipes along the bottom of the DS.

	Better center the pipe in the hole through the External Shielding.
	modified:   Mu2eG4/geom/Pipe_v03.txt

	Put the insulating vacuum in the TS cryostat sections.  The code
	changes were extensive, so did not version this - affects all 
	versions of the TS.  Should have no affect on any sensitive volumes,
	reconstruction, etc.
