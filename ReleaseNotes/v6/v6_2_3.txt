    disabled Mu2eG4/src/Mu2eG4Study_module.cc used in the g4study.fcl 
    g4study2.fcl etc... show how to use Mu2eG4 nodule instead
    also see ReleaseNotes/v5/v5_7_7.txt#3

    Geometry update.
    Restructured the logic of the pipe services.  Version 1 in the code
    works exactly as before.  Version 2 allows specification of default
    values for the lengths, and pipe-by-pipe overrides.  Thus a bunch of
    different-length pipes - but otherwise identical - can be specified 
    together, saving space and time in entering the description of the 
    pipes.  Pipe_v02.txt (using version 1 of the code) contained 1428 lines.  
    Pipe_v03.txt (using version 2 of the code) describes 
    the exact same set of pipes using 282 lines.  Updated geom_common_current
    to prefer the new version.  Old version still in geom_common for now.

    Geometry updates.
    Add materials we anticipate needing soon, Inconel718, TeflonFEP, and
    DC704.
    Inconel is a tough and stable alloy for support/stabilization rods.
    TeflonFEP is used in signal cables.  DC704 is diffusion pump oil.

    Take snapshots of some recent top-level geometry configurations used
    for simulation campaigns.  Hopefully the names are clear.
    Continue to collect most recent geometry changes in geom_common_current.
    Remove old and no longer used geom_commons (they can be revived by
    summoning from any Offline v6 tag prior to v6_2_3).

    Add an incredibly crude model of the diffusion pumps adjacent to the 
    VPSP and in the remote handling room.  Use our new DC704 material!
    Make it possible to selectively do surfaceChecks on Services.

    Simplify the constructions of cryostat saddles and stands.  Improves 
    heirarchy and reduces the number of geometric pieces needed to describe
    items.  Not in default geometry, added via geom_common_current.txt

3)  dnbrow01  11 June 2017
    Added an Option for an inner lining on the DS cryostat (inner in the 
    sense of being on axis side of the inner cryostat shell - toward the
    detectors).  This is by request for studying shielding.
    It is turned on and off by a single parameter:
    bool ds.hasInnerLining = false;  
    False is the default value and should only be changed by persons
    deliberately testing this lining.

    Separate saddle/stand construction from external shielding
    construction.  Prepare the code for a move to a better hierarchy
    for the saddles/stands.  Make a new Saddle_cd3a.txt file which
    (a) incorporates mods from UofL student Dustin Cox to update
    the description of stands in the PS to most recent drawings and
    (b) make saddles with curved edges rather than polygonal
    approximations.

1) brownd 8 June 2017
  Merge HitFilter branch with master: this includes refactoring of the LowE electron tracker hit filter
  module FlagBkgHits, with associated changes to data products, diagnostics, and algorithms.  The most
  important changes are:
  - Consistent use of 'bkg' to designate background objects and functions (replaces inaccurate 'delta')
  - Abstract interface to hit clustering
  - Relocation of relevant modules to TrkFilters and algorithms to TrkReco packages
  - Introduction of data products to record background clusters and classification
  - Removal of MC dependence and diagnostics from modules run in the trigger (M. Pettee)
  - Modernization and simplification of code and algorithms
  - Reduced memory thrashing and improved convergence in two-level-threshold (TLT) clustering algorithm
  These changes affect several packages (notably CalPatRec) through changes in include files, but no functional
  changes are expected there.  Functional changes in the track reconstruction sequence involve improved
  background filtering and reduced compuational time.
