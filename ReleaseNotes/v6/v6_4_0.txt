           move to art v2_09_04
           coordinated updates to several packages
	   technical fixes folowing changes in art

           Rewrote the cosmic DYB event generator in C++, and removed all Fortran references.
           New DYB generator allows event generation on the surfaces of a box.

	   of the pit to support a scintillating trigger panel for 
	   "garage" commissioning running.
	   modified:   Mu2eG4/geom/geom_common_garage.txt

	   Fixed a small memory leak.

	   Move the DS trench to the as-built position of 1 inch south of
	   nominal.  This does not affect any reconstruction, so can be
	   included in default and later geometries.

	   Added the PS exchange pipe to the geometry model. Does not affect
	   default geometry, only accessed via current geometry.

10)    	   dnbrow01  01 Dec 2017
      	   Improved managing garage position by consolidating all
 	   needed parameters into single file.  Thanks to Rob for the
	   suggestion.

      	   One last improvement to	version	5 of the tracker - right straw
	   positions without overlaps.
	   modified:   Mu2eG4/src/ConstructTTrackerDetail5.cc

9)	dnbrow01 01 Dec 2017
	Fix some issues related to z-placement in the new "version 5"
	Tracker.  Makes G4 and TTracker agree about positions of straws.
	modified:   Mu2eG4/src/ConstructTTrackerDetail5.cc

	Missed one place where StrawSD checks for TTracker version,
	and throws if not =5.
	modified:   Mu2eG4/src/StrawSD.cc

	Just my compulsive need to fix spelling...
	modified:   GeometryService/src/TTrackerMaker.cc

	Apparently, about 25% of the time, I can't add the number 4000	
	correctly... this fixes some overlaps
	modified:   Mu2eG4/geom/calorimeter_CsI_garage.txt

	Modify how the shift is	implemented for	building the
        garageFakeDS3Vacuum object.
	modified:   Mu2eG4/geom/geom_common_garage.txt
	modified:   Mu2eG4/src/constructDS.cc

	Make it	    possible to do selective overlap checking on the MBS...
	modified:   Mu2eG4/src/constructMBS.cc

	This module uses B-field direction to assign "transverse" momentum.
	Fine, except in	 the garage, where there     is no B-field.	
	When there is no B-field, now defaults to use z-axis.
	modified:   TrackerMC/src/StrawDigisFromStepPointMCs_module.cc

        I just have this inability to leave typos in comments alone...

6)      dnbrow01 27 Nov 2017
        Create geometry configuration files to create a "Garage Position"
	geometry for simulation of garage position cosmic commisioning.
	For this first pass, we assume:  - downstream external shielding
	is not yet installed; the CRV is not yet installed; the STM is
	not yet installed; the TTracker, Cal, and MBS are 10 m due east
	of nominal running position; the rest of the DS is in nominal
	position.  Some distinct surrealism here:  most notably, detectors
	that float!  But it is a beginning.  These changes do not affect
	default geometry or even current geometry.  These are only accessed
	by pointing your GeometryService at Mu2eG4/geom/geom_common_garage.txt

	Simulation works as expected with these changes, but there is still
	an issue with conversion of StepPointMCs to digis that must be 
	resolved.
 
	Utility files to simply remove shielding, if wanted.

 	 new file:   Mu2eG4/geom/ttracker_garage.txt

	 To make this work, we create a mimic of the DS3Vacuum volume
 	 shape and size, but fill it with air and place it 10 m East
 	 of the DS3Vacuum.  This now serves as the mother volume
 	 for the TTracker, Cal, MBS, and associated VirtualDetectors.
 	 The changes below do not affect performance for nominal 
 	 running.  All these changes are keyed off the presence of a
 	 bool named inGaragePosition.

5) 	dnbrow01  14 November 2017
	Had accidentally removed a setting for older versions of
	TTracker when putting in corresponding setting for newer version.
	Restored the old version with a switch for the new version.
	Also include the updated new TTracker with the updated inner ring.

	Improve	  memory footprint by reusing sets of straws among panels.
	Rationalize some function and object naming.  Prepare for use
	of Alignment in	 G4 stage of simulation.

	modified:   Mu2eG4/src/ConstructTTrackerDetail5.cc

3)      dnbrow01  12 November 2017
	Created a new version of the TTracker geometry that builds individual
	panels as they will be built instead of a bunch of copies of an
	idealized plane with copies of an identical plane of straws.  Here,
	each panel is built individually, and each straw within.  Will 
 	change back to identical bunches of straws in otherwise individually
	built panels to not hog so much memory.  Wanted to commit this
	so we have it.  The new version of the TTracker will not yet be
	seen by anybody unless they go well out of their way to use it.

1)    brownd, rbonventre  30 October 2017
Major upgrade to the StrawHit response model and simulation, including:
- refined cluster formation simulation for MIP particles
- electronics response model using transfer functions
- added data driven attenuation and dispersion model
- updated tuning of electronics parameters
- TimeOverThreshold (TOT) measurement in StrawDigi and downstream
- require coincidence between straw ends to create a digi as in FPGA
- Update StrawDigi and downstream interfaces to treat measurements at
each end of the straw the same
- use hardware names for the straw ends (cal, HV)
- remove MC diagnostics in MakeStrawHits module
