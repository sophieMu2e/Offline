           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v6_1_5

2) kutschke April 18, 2017
   Made tag to docment end of the geant 4.9.6 era.

   Just prior to makign the tag Andrei reverted a bunch of
   commits by Bob Bernstein.  A cursor check found some
   debug code that changed the behaviour of Mu2eG4SteppingAction
   in an unintended way.

   Multiple changes to Offline geometry.

   	       Add a rough model of the MBS spherical support.  Mass is
    	       correct according to doc-1351v7, though the fraction
  	       of bronze/brass and stainless are guesses and model is not
	       highly detailed.  Uses new material "MBSSupportMix".
	       Fix positions of bearing blocks on rails.
   new file:   Mu2eG4/geom/muonBeamStop_v04.txt
       	       Update details on the MBS according to v12 of the 
	       table of dimensions (not sure if it has a doc#).

   modified:   Mu2eG4/geom/TSdA_v01.txt
   new file:   Mu2eG4/geom/degrader_v01.txt
       	       Add support rings to OPA and guesses at rings for the 
	       stopping target support.  Update dimensions of the OPA,
	       TSdA, and add a simple model of the Pion degrader (with
	       a single text parameter to determine if it is in or 
	       out of the beamline).  This work corresponds to doc-7638,
	       doc-6654, doc-8391, and doc-1439 (WBS 5.07), with comments
	       from George Ginther and Hank Glass.

   modified:   Mu2eG4/geom/PSShield_v06.txt
	       Updated model of HRS to correct dimensions, materials, etc.
	       Corresponds to doc-3926-v3.  Checked with R. Coleman.

   modified:   Mu2eG4/geom/TransportSolenoid_v01.txt
   	       Fixed location of COL1 and size of upstream antiproton window,
	       based on doc-1044-v6 and communication from R. Coleman and 
	       G. Ginther.

   new file:   Mu2eG4/geom/geom_common_current.txt
       	       This will become the new current geom_common file, pointed
	       to by geom_common.txt, in the near future.  Will supersede 
	       the geom_common_cd3... files as defaults.

   new file:   Mu2eG4/test/geom_SurfaceCheck_ExtShieldsOnly.txt
       	       Prototype of a file to be used with a reduced surfaceCheck.
