   Removed unnecessary packing / unpacking in calorimeter digitization chain, removinh unneeded module and data product
   Renamed Calorimeter production module all singular (yes, these few scattered 's' were bothering me...)

6) Feb 13, 2017 kutschke

   bin/satelliteFuncs
     - Add setting of ROOT_INCLUDE_PATH to the setup.sh in a satellite release.

4) Feb 13, 2017 kutschke
   Renamed bin/genreflex.sh to bin/mu2e_genreflex
     - this is script is executed, not sourced - so no .sh
     - the base name is more accurate
   Modify SConstruct to use mu2e_genreflex
     - Remove the hard coded path to mu2e_genreflex and
       let the command be resolved from $PATH.

3) Feb 13, 2017 kutschke
   Add support for copying a build of Offline into a ups product.
   All files are in the ups_install directory.
   Later in the day change the ups product name from "Offline" to "offline".

2) Feb 13, 2017 kutschke
   Add support for building a release for use in the trigger.
     - Do not setup G4 and do not build any code that requires G4
     - Do not build Sandbox (keep HelloWorld for debugging)

   buildopts  - add a new option: --triggerStrip
   setup.sh   - do not setup geant4 if --triggerStrip is asserted
   SConstruct - remove selected SConscript files from the build.
