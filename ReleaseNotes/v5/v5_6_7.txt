           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v5_6_7

7) 26 Feb 2016  gandr
   Change passsivation at straw ends from +10 mm to -4mm.  This
   means that straws will have gain inside the support structure, which
   is what the current design is.

6) 25 Feb 2016  gandr
   Switch from G4_module to Mu2eG4_module in all jobs that use @local::g4run.

5) 25 Feb 2016  gandr
   Switch ReadBack_module from deprecated PointTrajectory to the
   MCTrajectory class.

4) 16 Feb 2016  dnbrow01
   Added materials Calcite, Dolomite, CA7Backfill, and RockBackfill in
   anticipation of inserting backfill around Mu2e building in Offline
   Geometry model.
   modified:   Mu2eG4/src/ConstructMaterials.cc

    - Make extending the track fit downstream through the calorimeter the default
    for all particle types.

    - Define overlapping panel list by discovery, not as a data object.
    The only assumption made is that even and odd stations have reversed
    planes.

     - The makeStation code made two copies of ipln1 rather than one
       copy each of ipln1 and ipln2.
     - The Station objects are never used in the construction of the G4
       representation: so the G4 simulations are OK.
     - We will investigate to learn if anyone relied on these.
