           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v5_6_1

10.  kutschke 20 Jan 2015
     Move management of the Mu2eDetectorModel object from GeometryService to BTrkHelper.
     With this change, it is only necessary to configure the BTrkHelper service when you
     run the BTrk code; in particular it is not necessary to configure the BTrkHelper service
     in pure sim code.
        BTrkHelper/inc/BTrkHelper.hh
        BTrkHelper/src/BTrkHelper_service.cc
        BTrkHelper/src/SConscript
        GeometryService/inc/GeometryService.hh
        GeometryService/src/GeometryService_service.cc
        GeometryService/src/SConscript

     Code that uses Mu2eDetectorModel now must get it from BTrkHelper:
        CalPatRec/src/KalFitHack.cc
        ParticleID/src/AvikPID_module.cc
        ParticleID/src/ParticleID_module.cc
        TrkReco/src/KalFit.cc

    - Added an absorber inside the axial hole in the MBS to prevent
      muons from escaping outside downstream of the DS (to reduce
      CRV deadtime). Increased default axial opening radii of MBS
      hole and ifb window so the STM can't see their inner edges.
    - Prior to this commit the IFB window was 5cm of Mylar by default.
      Now the IFB vacuum window is again a normal thin Mylar window.
    - Added new producer module: StoppedMuonXRayGammaRayGun

    Mu2eG4_module now produces SimParticleRemapping when used in the
    multi-stage mode.  This allows to use a separate module for
    updating Ptr<SimParticle> in any other product to the current
    stage SimParticleCollection.


7.  dnbrow01  17 Jan 2016
    Add two new virtual detectors, one each in the middle of the bend of
    TS2 and TS4.  This was requested by Mau for B field studies.
    The new virtual detectors are named TS2_Bend and TS4_Bend.
    In the VirtualDetectorId enum, they are numbers 98 and 99.

    Use new straw hit making code
      - Mu2eG4/fcl/g4test_03.fcl
      - Mu2eG4/fcl/transportOnly.fcl

5.  brownd 16 jan 2016     Note added by kutschke
    Remove the obsolete MakeStrawHit_module.cc
      - No one should be using this any more.

4.  brownd 8 jan 2016
    Add straw materials to the Kalman filter track fit for straws which
    don't have hits, but which the trajectory indicates are traversed by the
    particle.  This improves the core momentum resolution and the tracking
    efficiency.

3.  kutschke 7, Jan 2016
    Added BTrkHelper to the configuration of
      JobConfig/cd3/validation/stoppedMuonsSingleStage.fcl
      Mu2eG4/fcl/transportOnly.fcl
      Mu2eG4/fcl/g4test_01.fcl
      Mu2eG4/fcl/g4test_02.fcl
      Mu2eG4/fcl/g4test_03.fcl
      Mu2eG4/fcl/surfaceCheck.fcl

    This is a stop gap measure to get the nighty tests working again.
    The longer term solution is to define table fragments for the sets of services
    needed for sim and reco.

2.  brownd  6 Jan 2016
    Further refactoring of the BTrk code.  The major change is the creation
    of an actual Mu2e DetectorModel (BaBar style offline geometry/material),
    and removing the previous hacks to get the KalmanFilter to work without
    this.  The changes that might be visible to users is that the
    TrkStrawHit moved from Mu2eBTrk to TrkReco (to avoid dependency loops),
    and moving the material-related classes (used in PID) from TrkStrawHit
    to DetTrkElem.  Internally, the material modeling of the straws used in
    the Kalman fit was consolidated and simplified, which reduces the size of
    the KalRep object, speeds the fitting, and slightly improves the fit
    results.  This update also provide all the structural changes needed to
    add materials from inefficient straws to the Kalman fit.

1.  dnbrow01  24 Dec 2015
    Fix the length of the wires of the IPA support (version 2) recently
    introduced by Andy Edmonds.  This fix avoids an overlap issue but
    should be understood better.
