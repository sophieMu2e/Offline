           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v5_5_8

1) Dec 18, 2015 brownd
    Refactoring of BTrk code in preparation for track persistence.  This
    mainly affects the interface of tracks to hits.  Many files have been
    changed, and though standard Offline tests have been verified, private
    code and/or scripts, and code not part of the standard tests may still
    need modification.

    The major visible change is that the KalmanTests package has been split
    into 3 new packages divided by function:
      -Mu2eBTrk holds the Mu2e-specific subclasses of BTrk base classes.
      -TrkReco holds basic track reconstruction algorithms
      -TrkDiag holds classes and modules used for testing and reading tracks
    In addition, persistent class definitions that were in KalmanTests have
    been moved into the appropriate *DataProducts packages.  Some algorithms
    formerly in TrkPatRec have been moved to TrkReco, and more may follow as
    we continue to refactor and consolidate.
    The KalmanTests package still exists, but holds only DEPRECATED CODE.
    Remaining references to KalmanTests in the code base need to be refactored
    as it will be removed in a future tag.
