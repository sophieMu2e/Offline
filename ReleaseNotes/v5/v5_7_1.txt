           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v5_7_1

5) 27 March 2016   kutschke
   Over the past few days Ralf committed a lot of CRV changes.  Most are
   production/analysis releated.  Yuri says that there is an important
   geometry change related to thickness of steel.

   Added a class for representing Electronics racks (PCBs, crates, enclosures).
   Simple representation as boxes with average material uniformly distributed
   throughout.  Added the mechanism for building the racks, and the material
   to represent rack electronics.  Did not place any racks at this time as
   we are still awaiting an actual determination of the material from tests.

   Added the ServicesGeom directory for handling the geometry of services
   such as pipes and electronics racks.  Implemented Pipes and placed the
   first two pipes (requested for radiation safety studies).  Created a new
   material G10Lite to represent the G10 webbing within some pipes.
