           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v5_8_0

4) dnbrow01  28 Sept 2016
   Move the crate on top of the downstream calorimeter disk so it is oriented
   identically to the crate on top of the upstream calorimeter disk.  Make
   the dimensions of the crates a bit more like the dimensions of the
   expected crates.

   TrkDiag/test/ce.C
     - New file to illustrate how to produce tracking quality
       control plots from the TTree created by ReadKalFits.
   TrkDiag/test/KalFit.C
     - Change a single % to %% where a single % is undefined behaviour.

    Analyses/src/ReadBack_module.cc
      - Switch to use:  MCDataProducts/inc/PhysicalVolumeInfoMultiCollection.hh
        Instead of:     MCDataProducts/inc/PhysicalVolumeInfoCollection.hh
      - This re-enables printout of SimParitlces.

    HitMakers/src/ReadStrawHit_module.cc
     - remove obsolete code
     - it consumed random numbers and seeds; this meant that adding
       and subtracting this analyzer module from and endpath
       changed the behaviour of random numbers in other modules
       (via changes to the seed sequence).

    Analyses/test/readback.fcl .  Add back call to ReadStrawHit.

    Added pump-out holes to MBS.  Add two new versions:  version 4 = version 2
    plus holes; version 5 = version 3 plus holes.  As a reminder, version 3
    included Anthony Palladino's parameter control for the beampipe cutout
    at the downstream end of the MBS.  Default version was 3, is now 5.
    Also updated the floor of the remote handling area by expanding the floor
    out to the walls, which were updated earlier this year.  Files touched:

   Fixed a bug in the straw digi creation that was leaving us with two copies
   of the same straw hit for hits at early times, t < 100 ns. This does not 
   affect any of the CD3 simulations since we do not simulate any beam flash 
   with t < 500 ns. Files touched:
