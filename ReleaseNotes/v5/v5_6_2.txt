           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v5_6_2

   setup.sh
     Bump geant4 version version 4.9.6.p04d from .p04c.  This picks up
     some fixes for the infinite loop that we hit a handful of times in the
     targeted cosmic ray jobs.  The infinite loop occured only for boolean
     solids when a particle was parallel to one of the surfaces.  It was
     fixed in v4.10 and Krzysztof back-ported it to make .p04d.

      -Use the GA05 field maps for the 4 main maps; continue to use the Mau9 maps
       for the other maps.

   We are about to start a second pass of stages 3, 4 amd mixing for the cd3c
   simulation campaign.  To prep for this I have updated the organization of the
   geometry files.

   Remove:
       Mu2eG4/geom/geom_common_cd3.txt

   Replace it with:
       Mu2eG4/geom/geom_common_cd3_p1.txt
       Mu2eG4/geom/geom_common_cd3_s3p2.txt

   where _p1 was used for all of pass1 of the simulations ( beam and cosmic ) and
   where _s3p2 will be used for pass2 of stage 3.  Both should work with the new
   code - they describe different geometries.

   There will be a _s4p2 when we start pass 2 or stage 4. There will also need to
   be special versions for background sim and signal sim; we want to simulate
   signal with 18 stations but we want to simulation backgrounds with 20 stations
   and deading 2 stations at hit creation time.

   Changes to the content of the geometry files:

   Relative to Mu2eG4/geom/geom_common_cd3.txt, the changes are:

     Mu2eG4/geom/geom_common_cd3_p1.txt
       - restore the pass 1 style IPA

     Mu2eG4/geom/geom_common_cd3_s3p2.txt
       - Keep the new style IPA

   Implicit in the above is that the _p1 file contains two changes that were not really
   pass 1 - the calorimeter electronics boxes and the newest MSTM.  The first is OK since
   it does not affect reco, only sim.  The second is OK since we never wrote out MSTM
   info in pass 1.

   Also updated:
     Mu2eG4/geom/geom_common.txt
     Mu2eG4/test/geom_cd3.txt

   to use the _s3p2 file.

    More ttracker related variable renames dev -> pln:
       ExtinctionMonitorFNAL/test/gdefsEMFCommon.txt
       ExtinctionMonitorFNAL/test/geom_emfMARS.txt
       JobConfig/TDR/geom_baseline.txt
       Mu2eG4/src/ConstructTTrackerTDR.cc
    Added diagnostic printout:
       GeometryService/src/TTrackerMaker.cc

    - Modified IPA so that the end rings are inside the IPA and not outside
    - Also construct the end rings before the wires so that we see the overlaps if we just do a surface check in this volume
    - Swapped the radial and longitudinal lengths of the end rings so that they are the right way round
    - Made the cylindirical R = 300 mm, L/2 = 500 mm and Z = 630 mm downstream of the stopping target the default IPA geometry

    Add a crude model for the Calorimeter electronics crates based on a
    model by Yuri O.  The outer radius of the crates had to be reduced to
    avoid overlaps at this time - this could and should be revisited in
    the near future, but at least this model gets some material where it
    should be.  Added a new material "Electronics" to support the new crates.
    Also added a first, crude, model of the bearing blocks along the rails
    in the DS.  Had to remove the blocks under the TTracker due to overlaps
    for the moment.  This will need to be revisited also.
