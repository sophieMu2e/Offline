      - in BFieldManagerMaker::readG4BLBinary the file descriptor
        for the binary field map file was never closed.  This left
        open file descriptors hanging around until the end of job.
      - Fixed in this commit

    More geometry updates.  
    i)  Added "filler" material in the calorimeter mother volume, in the
        region between the downstream suface of the Calorimeter disks and
	the MBS.  By default, this material is not built, but can be 
	included by using the config parameter bool calorimeter.useFiller =
	true.  The filler is a tube with parameter-controlled inner and 
	outer radii, length, z-position, and material.
    ii) Added two new materials - "DS1CoilMix" and "DS2CoilMix" to better
        represent the material in the superconducting cables (by representing
    	the Al stiffener).  Modified code so not all coils are forced to
	be made of the same material.  Nominally set the materials
	according to description in chapter 6 in the TDR. 
    iii) Added Aluminum spacers (simplified model) in the gaps between coils,
        from coil 3 to coil 8 (the most significant spaces).  Introduced
	a coilVersion number.  Coil version 1 is the coil setup before
	introducing spacers and the new materials.  Coil version 2 adds 
	these features.

    Changed the DYB cosmic event generator to allow user defined phi ranges
    for the generated cosmic ray muons. The phi range can be set in the 
    genconfig file. The event generator adjusts the cosmic rate accordingly.
    Example:
    string cosmicDYB.refPointChoice  = "Customized";
    string cosmicDYB.directionChoice = "Phi_Range";
    double cosmicDYB.muPhiMin = -1.570;
    double cosmicDYB.muPhiMax =  0;
    double cosmicDYB.dx     = 0;
    double cosmicDYB.dy     = 5000;
    double cosmicDYB.dz     = 5000;
    vector<double> cosmicDYB.cosmicReferencePointInMu2e = {-104,200,0};

    Various geometry-related updates.
    i)  Scrubbed more unnecessary #includes per work done by Bryan Fagan.
    ii) Added pipes throughout, based on G4beamline files, which are not quite
        correct.  More work to be done here, but this gets pipes throughout
        active region.  Implementation by Bryan Fagan.
    iii) Added the mechanism to put holes in the MBS, without yet implementing.
    iv) Fixed angular coverage of the graphite collar insert in the Pbar 
    	absorber in TS1.
