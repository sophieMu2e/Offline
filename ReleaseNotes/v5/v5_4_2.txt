    - Notes added by kutschke
    In the CRV event generator, fixed a bug in the CRV code
    that affected the azimuthal direction of tracks when
    the production plane is vertical.

   Added support for correlated particles in RootTreeSampler and
   implemented new module InFlightParticleSampler.  Related changes to
   other generator modules that re-sample stopped muons.

   Moved common data structures from individual modules into
   GeneralUtilities.

    Changed the way to set up and build non-default configurations:
       - setup.sh will not accept any options
       - scons will not recognize the --mu2elevel and --mu2egs options
       - use Offline/buildopts to set the options (try ./buildopts --help)

    The supported buildopts are --build (prof or debug) and --g4vis
    (ogl, qt, none).  The options are sticky.  One must source setup.sh
    in a new shell after a build options change.
