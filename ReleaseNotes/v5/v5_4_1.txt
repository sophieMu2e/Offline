           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v5_4_1

6) July 9, 2015 - kutschke
   Add -Werror to the compiler flags.
   Any compiler warning will now be promoted to an error and stop compilation.

5) July 9, 2015 - kutschke
   Use the new feature of SConstruct (4) to add
     -fvar-tracking-assignments-toggle
   to the dictionary maker for MCDataProducts and RecoDataProducts.
   When compiling the _dict.cpp files for these data packages, the
   compiler exhausts memory and falls back to a mode that produces less
   complete symbol information for debuggers - this occurs in both profile
   and debug builds. The addition of this flag tells the compile not to
   try the producing the full information and to immediately fall back to
   the less complete mode.  This saves 30 seconds or so in each build.

4) July 9, 2015 - kutschke
   Modify SConstruct to allow an optional argument to
      helper.make_dict_and_map
   This allows the user to pass additional options to the compilation
   step of the _dict.cc file.

3) July 9, 2015 - kutschke
   Add configuration for BTrkHelper to all .fcl files that
   run any module using TrkPatRec or CalPatRec. Hope we
   found them all.

2) July 9, 2015 - kutschke, murat
   Over the past few days fix all remaining compiler warnings.
