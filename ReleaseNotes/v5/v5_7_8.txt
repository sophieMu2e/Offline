           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v5_7_8

5) ehrlich 5 August, 2016
   added Mu2eG4/geom/studies/crv_counters_v03_no_CRV_D4.txt
   which removed the lower part of the CRV-D

   Changed SConstruct so that both satellite releases and base
   releases prefix .so files with "libmu2e_".  The previous
   behaviour was that satellite release .so files were prefixed
   "libmu2euser_".  The use case for this does not actually work;
   without that it's just int the way.

3) kutschke 20 July, 2016
   Removed 4 obsolete scripts:
     bin/cleanTestRelease
     bin/createTestRelease
     bin/rebindTestRelease
     bin/rebindSatelliteRelease
   The first two are superceded by createSatelliteRelease and cleanSatelliteRelease.
   The last two are a failed experiment to combine clean followed by create into
   a single script.  The problem is that the create step must be done in a clean
   terminal window.

   To learn how to use the satellite release system, see:

2) brownd 16 July 2016
    Introduced TrkDiag/TrackAnalysis module and associated helpers, structs,
    and configuration.
    Aggregated service configurations into some standard targets in
    fcl/standardServices.

    Made Geometry code by default less verbose.  Some code was 
    bypassing verbosityLevel checks - fixed those.  Some was using
    unusual verbosityLevel checks - such as > -1.  Standardized these.
    Some text files just had verbosityLevel turned on without need.
    Modified the level to 0.  Does not affect performance of the code
    or anything in the actual Geometry - just tidying up.
