     - The trilinear interpolation code did not use the
       scale factor.  The code now multiplies the final
       result by the scale factor.

    Updates to the CosmicRayShieldGeom directory and the Mu2eG4/geom/crv_counters.txt file.
    Removed a lot of hard-coded settings. This makes it possible,
    that data files produced with different CRV versions can still be read,
    if the appropriate CRV geometry configuration file is used.
    Added some functions to convert between world and local CRV bar coordinates.
    Modified Files:
      Mu2eG4/geom/crv_counters.txt
      almost all files in CosmicRayShieldGeom
