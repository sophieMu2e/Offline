           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v5_4_4

9) August 14, 2015 kutschke
   (Actutally done on August 11).
   Added code in the sandbox to illustrate a link/load problem
   if in-module-file helper functions are just in the mu2e namespace
   with no additional scope control ( unnamed namespace or inside
   the module class)
    - Sandbox/src/Helper*_module.cc
    - Sandbox/test/helper*.fcl

8) August 14, 2015 kutschke
   Following discussions with Bob B I removed the obsolete file
    Mu2eG4/test/geom_STM.txt
   This would have required maintenance to deal with items 6 and 7.

7) August 14, 2015 gandr
   Switched to the 34 foil stoppign target geometry for most jobs
   while keeping the TDR target for the ongoing cosmic simulations.

6) August 13, 2015 roehrken
   added geometry files for the muon stopping target:

   Mu2eG4/geom/stoppingTarget_TDR.txt           17 foil tapered target as has been used for the TDR simulation campaign

   Mu2eG4/geom/stoppingTarget_CD3C_34foils.txt  34 foil untapered target as will be used for the CDC3 simulation campaign

5) July 31, 2015 kutschke
   BFieldTest/test/BFieldTest.fcl
    - add include for standardServices
    - Removed obsolute services.user

   BFieldGeom/test/makeBinaryMaps.fcl
   BFieldGeom/test/readBinaryMaps.fcl
    - add time map modules
    - cleanup targets of opportunity.


4) July 31, 2015 kutschke
   Add a module to check if maps with the symmmetry "extendY flip=By" in fact
   have this symmetry.
     - BFieldTest/src/BFieldSymmetry_module.cc
     - BFieldTest/test/BFieldSymmetry.fcl

3) July 24, 2015 genser

    Disambiguated Foil_ TargetFoil_ and FoilSupportStructure logical volume
    names by basically doing:
    std::ostringstream os; os << std::setfill('0') << std::setw(2) << itf;
    foilInfo.name = "Foil_" + os.str();
    similarly for the physical ones; updated config parameter names using the current ones

      Mu2eG4/src/constructStoppingTarget.cc      - the core of the changes, also broken the very long lines
      Analyses/src/BkgRates_module.cc            - changed the handling of TargetFoil_
      Analyses/src/CEL_module.cc
      Analyses/src/RPC_module.cc
      Analyses/src/ReadStoppedPis_module.cc
      Analyses/src/ReadVirtualDetector_module.cc
      Analyses/src/StoppingTarget00_module.cc
      Mu2eG4/geom/ProductionTargetInPS.txt       - added productionTarget.verbosity in comments
      Mu2eG4/test/transportOnlyGeom.txt          - removed obsolete config parameter names


2)  David Norvil Brown (Louisville).  23 July 2015
    Modification to ExternalShieldingGeom/src/ExtShieldDownstreamMaker.cc
    by UofL student Kyle Steffen to read notch information from
    vector<double> instead of multiple doubles.  Makes ExtShieldDownstream
    geometry text file smaller and more readable.
    Modifications to Mu2eG4/geom/ExtShieldDownstream_v01.txt by DNB to take
    advantage of Kyle's mods and also to make external shielding more
    consistent with TeamCenter version - particularly barite vs. concrete
    near the Stopping Target.
    Added comments to Mu2eBuildingGeom/src/Mu2eBuildingMaker.cc and
    Mu2eG4/geom/mu2eBuilding.txt to indicate mu2eBuilding is deprecated
    and superceded by mu2eHall.  Will remove altogether in near future
    release.

1) July 20, echenard

   - cleaned disk geometry - using a single logical volume for the crystals
   - Updated data product CaloHitSimPartMC to remove the dependance of
     StepPointMC, so they can be dropped from the data file
