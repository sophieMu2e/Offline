           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v5_7_7

10) 8 July, 2016: kutschke
   Update the satellite release scripts.
     - Refactor common code into bash functions maintained
       in bin/satelliteFuncs.
     - Never delete or move the out directory if it already
       exists.
     - Deal with more corner cases.

9) 8 July, 2016: kutschke
   Update genReco.fcl to use the most recent ReadKalFits
   configuration; enable the addition of the calorimeter related
   parts of the ReadKalFits TTree.

   More removal of unneeded #includes from Geometry-related files, per
   Bryan Fagan (see note 7 below).  Also reduced verbosity of some 
   Geometry modules
   (constructServicesGeom, constructStoppingTarget, protonAbsorber).

   Removing unneeded #includes from the Geometry-related files.  Starting
   here with the files in BeamlineGeom.  This is a project undertaken by
   Bryan Fagan, Louisville student.  I (DNB) am testing his changes and 
   commiting them.

     - Removed obsolete member function  make_dict_and_map_hack from
       the helper python class.

   Bug fix in the Daya Bat cosmic ray event generator.
   The CosmicDYB.cc event generator calls fortran code to do some of its work.
   With commit f77d6d9f9965d35336f27666a6a4b23e0475ead2 on Mar 22, 2014,
   a new argument was added to the fortran function hrndg2.  This argument
   is a fortran logical, which has a length of 4 bytes.  The object passed to
   to the fortran code was a C++ bool which has a length of 1 byte.  So the
   fortran code receives the bool plus 3 bytes of stale memory.  If any bit is
   set in the 3 stale bytes, a C++ false will be intepretted in Fortran as
   true.  A C++ true is always correctly interpretted as a fortran true.
   To fix this problem, the representation is transformed in the adapter
   inline function in:

     EventGenerator/inc/hrndg2.hh

   Separated out the ServicesGeom construction into its own function from
   constructExternalShielding, where it had been temporarily housed.  No
   functional difference here, but cleaner code.  Added the ability to 
   make bends in pipes.  In support of this change, created a TorusParams
   class parallel to TubsParams and updated nestTorus to add this as
   an optional argument.

   First implementation of g4study (named g4study2) using the new
   Mu2eG4_module.  g4study was left using G4_module. The idea is to
   use the fhicl configuration, as e.g. in g4study2.fcl to reproduce
   the old g4study simple config based behavior 

   After the changes
   Mu2eG4/fcl/g4study2.fcl          gives same results as Mu2eG4/fcl/g4study.fcl
   Mu2eG4/fcl/g4study2Calo_01.fcl   same as               Mu2eG4/fcl/g4studyCalo_01.fcl
   Mu2eG4/fcl/g4study2MuCapture.fcl same as               Mu2eG4/fcl/g4studyMuCapture.fcl

   Changed the CRV waveform structure.

1) May 27, 2016 oksuzian
   Fixed a bug in OPA geometry. The OPA shape was tapered from 2 to 0.05 cm. 
   Updated OPA to table 2 parameters in WBS 5.07 docdb-1439v7
