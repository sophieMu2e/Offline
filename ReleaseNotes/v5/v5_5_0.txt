    Analyses/src/DataProductDump_module.cc

    The detail class inside Analyses/src/DataProductDump_module.cc is now
    required to perform parameter set validation. As it happens the
    detail function does not use itâ€™s parameter set so validation is trivial;
    all that I had to do was the create an empty struct named Config in
    the appropriate namespace.

    This requirement follows from the fact that this module is an
    instantiation of a module template and the template does parameter set
    validation; with the present implementation of parameter set
    validation, once the choice is made that the module will do parameter
    set validation, the requirement flows through to the detail function.

  The art team has decided to deprecate two member functions
  of fhicl::ParameterSet.  The member functions get_keys() and
  get_pset_keys() have been replaced by new functions named
  get_names() and get_pset_names(), respectively.  The reason for
  the change was to synchronize the code with the documentation.  At a
  later date get_keys() and get_pset_keys() will reappear but with
  a somewhat different functionality.  The replacement functions now
  exist and the old functions have been marked as deprecated.
  Deprecation produces warnings that we promote to errors with -Werror.

  I changed all instances of the old functions to the new ones:
     BFieldTest/src/BFieldTest_module.cc
     GeneralUtilities/src/ParameterSetFromFile.cc
     Mu2eG4/src/Mu2eG4TrajectoryControl.cc
     Stntuple/mod/TModule.cc

   Previously the compiler warned about unused variables.  It now
   also warns about unused references. We promote all warnings to
   errors using the -Werror compiler flag.  To fix thisI removed
   all unused references that were flagged by the compiler.
