7) Nov 20, 2015 gandr
   Committed fcl scripts for first round of pbar studies.

6) Nov 19, 2015 kutschke
   SConstruct
      - closed links are now enabled by default
   Last round of commits SConscript files with proper link lists.

5) Nov 19, 2015 kutschke
   EventDisplay/src/EventDisplayFrame.h
     - Deleted the declaration of an unimplemented function in order to
       enable closed links of the dictionary.

   Took EarlyPatRec out of the build by renaming the SConscript file.
   This directory will go away soon.

   CalPatrec/src/SConscript now does closed links but it was a lot
   of work to get there.

   The BTrk class KalContext declares but does not provide a copy
   c'tor and an copy assignment operator; this is intentional, to
   prevent copying.

   The package requires that a root dictionary be built for a class
   that inherits from KalContext.  Therefore a closed link is impossible.
   To fix this I added:

    CalPatRec/src/KalContextHack.cc

   which contains implmentations of the missing functions. These
   implementations throw an exception if these functions are ever
   called ( which they should not be ).

   There are several classes in the dictionary that invoke the ClassDef
   macro.  The effect of this is that mainlib and the the dictionary cannot
   be linked separately with a closed link in both.

   To fix this I added a new member function to the helper class in SConstruct;
   this function builds the the dictionary but also includes all code that
   would normally go into the mainlib; the mainlib is not built.

   EventGenerator/src/ExtMonFNALBoxGenerator_module.cc

   This code used to check each incoming PDGId to see if G4
   knew about that PDGId.  This happened when running stage
   2 and greater jobs, reading in ions, nuclei and excited
   nuclei created by G4 in an earlier stage.  Because G4
   creates particle table entries for these particles "on demand"
   and inside the hadronic physics code, they do not, in general
   exist in the particle table when a job starts, such as at
   the start of stage 2.

   Usually these particles had very low kinetic energy.  The
   hack fix was to replace the unknown particle with a proton with
   same kinetic energy.

   This behaviour caused a runtime dependence on G4.

   Since the creation of this hack, the G4 UserPrimaryGeneratorAction
   has been improved.  It now knows how to parse nuclei and ion ID
   codes and correctly sends them to G4.

   So the hack is no longer needed and has been removed.

   Mu2eG4/inc/QGSP_BERT_HP_MU2E00.icc
     The code in the muoncapture subdirectory is not being built
     because it needs some maintenance. Therefore attempts to use
     it cause a link-time failure when closed links are enabled.
     Therefore I had to remove the option to use this code.

     If you try to use the unavailable code an exception will be
     thrown.
