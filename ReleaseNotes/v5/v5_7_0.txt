           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v5_7_0

16) March 22, 2016, kutschke
    Moved TrkStrawHit from TrkReco to a new subdirectory BTrkData.
    Modified Analyses/src/SConstruct to link against BTrKData.so.
    This ensures that the 86 modules in Analyses/src do not need to be rebuilt
    when algorithms in TrkReco are modified; TrkStrawHit is not changed frequently.

    This is a bit icky because the subdirectory has only a single class.
    This will be addressed in a later reorganization.

    May #include directives and SConscript link lists needed to be updated to
    find TrkStrawHit in its new location.

   Tune the tracker straw response to match the LBL prototype measurements.
   This includes revising the implementation of the straw gain to include
   physical models of the # of electrons/cluster and gain fluctuations.
   Details, including comparisons with measurements and validation plots,
   are described in doc 6962.
