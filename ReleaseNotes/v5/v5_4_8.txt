   HitMakers/fcl/prolog.fcl
    - I am not 100% sure that this is the right way to fix the problem ....
    - The immediate problem was that in Mu2eG4/fcl/g4test_03.fcl
      the module label CaloCrystalHitsMaker produced no output because it
      could not find it's inputs.  The problem was that the definition
         caloReadoutModuleLabel : MakeCaloReadoutHits

      should have been:
         caloReadoutModuleLabel : "CaloReadoutHitsMaker"

    - So I fixed it.  I scanned about 10 other fcl files and this change
      was needed for all of them.
    - The change makes no difference to Analyses/test/genReco.fcl
      which uses a different crystal hit maker.
    - So the stuff I know how to test works but I don't know about the stuff
      I do not know how to test.

     - Add printout for GenParticles

   modified:   Analyses/src/ReadVirtualDetector_module.cc
   new 	   :   Analyses/test/vd_readStage2.fcl

   Several changes in ReadVirtualDetector module:
   - configuration variables, which describe input collection, are now 
     tags, which support the complex names (e.g. "g2run:DSVolume"). Before
     they were just the name of the collection.
   - added new configuration variable, "minMomentum", which allows to save
     only high energy particles in the ntuple. Default is -1 (no cut).
   - added example Analyses/test/vd_readStage2.fcl, which shows how to 
     read VD data from CD3 stage 2 simulation with this module
