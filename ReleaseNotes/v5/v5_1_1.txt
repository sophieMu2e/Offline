    Restructure KalDiag to return information by structs.  Structs
    return descriptions of the variables as TTree leaves, allow the
    entire struct to be placed as a branch without exposing any details.
    There are small changes in ReadKalFits TTree branch names as a result.
    New features allow major simplification to Reflect_module.
    primary changes in:
      KalmanTests/*/KalDiag and included files
      KalmanTests/src/Reflect_module.cc
      KalmanTests/src/ReadKalFits_module.cc
    follow-on effects:
      KalmanTests/test/KalFit.C
      JobConfig/TDR/digiMixAndTrackFile.fcl
      Mu2eG4/test/sthktfO.C

    Changed the interface to G4RunManager: Used its new (requested by
    Mu2e) API instead of inheriting from it. The change should
    decrease the need for potential future maintenance
    (also minimally modified timing printout) 

    Deleted files:    
      Mu2eG4/inc/Mu2eG4RunManager.hh
      Mu2eG4/src/Mu2eG4RunManager.cc

    Modified Files:
      Mu2eG4/src/G4_module.cc
      Mu2eG4/src/Mu2eG4Study_module.cc
