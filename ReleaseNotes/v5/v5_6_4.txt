           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v5_6_4

7) Feb 05, 2016  dnbrow01
   Change the outer radius of the calorimeter mother volume in the 
   new calorimeter geometry file, calorimeter_CsI.txt, to work with
   crates.  
   modified:   Mu2eG4/geom/calorimeter_CsI.txt

   Special geometry file that should only be used for generating backgrounds, not signals.
   Mu2eG4/geom/geom_common_cd3_s4p2_backgroundSim.txt

5) Feb 05, 2016  kutschke
   Restored Mu2eG4/geom/geom_common_cd3_s3p2.txt to use the BaF2 calorimeter
   and not the CsI calorimeter. The file geom_common_cd3_s3p2.txt is intended
   to document that the state of the geometry at stage 3 pass2, not the
   current state.

   Change the meaning of a large negative value of the geometry file parameter:
     double ttracker.passivationMargin;
   If this parameter modifies the length of the active region of the wire.  The
   physical length of the wire extends into the manifold.  If this parameter
   has a value of 0, then the active length of the wire extends from the center
   of the wire to the point at which the line along the wire enters the manifold.
   If this parameter is positive, then the active length is shortened by the indicated
   amount; the active length is limited so that it can never be negative. If this
   parameter is positive, then the active length extends into the manifold by the indicated
   amount.

   The new behaviour is that the active length is limited to the full length of the wire.

   The old behaviour was that the computed active length could be longer than the physical
   length; this resulted in run time error.

   Added version control to calorimeter crates.  To turn on building of
   crates, one needs to add
   int calorimeter.calorimeterCrateVersion = 2;
   (or higher) to the calorimeterXXX.txt file being used.  If not present,
   default to crate version 1, which does not build crates.
   Added version = 2 flag to current calorimeter geom file,
   calorimeter_BaF2.txt.  TDR-era geometry files should not choke on this.

      - default geometry is now Mu2eG4/geom/geom_common_cd3_s4p2.txt
