   Mu2eG4/geom/ExtShieldUpstream_cd3.txt
   Mu2eG4/geom/Saddle_cd3.txt

   Froze the cd3c version of the external shielding geometry configurations.
   These files now pointed to by geom_common_cd3.txt
   In the "working" version of ExtShieldDownstream_v01.txt, added two
   stainless steel blocks from Dave Hedin's shielding studies, per
   request from Yuri Oksuzian

   Replaced iron vacuum seal with 5 cm Mylar plug
   Added 1%, 3%, 5% borated concrete
   Seperated T-blocks around the stopping target from other type of blocks. Will allow to set different concrete materials in upstream and around the stopping target.

      Undergraduate Dustin Cox (Louisville) removed some spurious debugging
      messages left in code from development.  Checking in changes for him.

      There was on other fcl file that used @local::muonStops.  Now changed
      to  @local::mu2e.tgtMuonStops.

   EventGenerator/fcl/prolog.fcl
     StopMuonConversionGun and StoppedParticleReactionGun were still using
     @local::muonStops.  Switched to @local::mu2e.tgtMuonStops."
   This meant that they were still getting the tdr era stopped muon file,
   not the cd3 version.

   When I removed the user block from services, I forgot to update:

     services.user.SeedService.baseSeed         :  0
     services.user.SeedService.maxUniqueEngines :  20

   to

     services.SeedService.baseSeed         :  0
     services.SeedService.maxUniqueEngines :  20

  This is fixed in:
    Mu2eG4/fcl/g4test_01.fcl
    Mu2eG4/fcl/g4test_02.fcl
    Mu2eG4/fcl/g4test_03.fcl
    Analyses/test/genMixReco.fcl
