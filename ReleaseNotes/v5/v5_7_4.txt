   Few people remember release notes for this time release.
   The purpose of the release is to use it for the rerunning
   of cosmic stage 3.
    - The previous version of stage 3 was run with the old tracker
      hit making.  The new version will be run with the most recent
      version
    - Update job and filter configurations for cosmic stage 3.
    - Improved cut and count analysis (not used in stage 3
      but needed to vet later stages ).
    - Bug fix in TrackerMC/src/StrawWaveform.cc
    - Ongoing improvements to CRV simulation and reco
    - Ongoing improvements to Calo reco.
    - Onging work to merge TrkPatRec and CalPatRec.
         - one of these changes involves a schema change
         - to read and write old files with new code requires
           that you disable fast cloning
