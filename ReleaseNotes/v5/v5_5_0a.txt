           Additional release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v5_5_0

These are an addition to the release notes for v5_5_0.  They were added
after v5_5_0 was tagged - so they only appear in tags v5_5_1 and later.
Release notes for v5_5_1 should go into v5_5_1.txt

     This is a correction to item 4 from v5_5_0.
       - I did remove an unused reference.
       - But there was no deprecated parameter set behaviour
     The other change is that I removed all of the lines associated with
     a data product for which there was a produces call but no put call.
     To see the differences:

   One of the new features in this version of art is that it will be an error if a
   producer module to fails to call put on a data product for which there is a produces
   call.  We believe that there are few, if any, legitmate use cases for this behaviour
   and the majority of cases that it occurs are indeed errors.

   See the release notes for art v1_17_00
      https://cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/projects/art/wiki/Release_Notes_11700

   If you have this behaviour in your code, you will need to fix it.
