           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v5_4_0

This file was updated after the tag v5_4_0 was made - so you need to
checkout v5_4_1 or greater in order to get this version.

All items by kutschke, July 6, 2015.

1)
We now use art v1_15_00.

2)
A side effect of 1) is that the art::CPUTimer changed to cet::cpu_timer.
This required a few changes in our code base.   See
https://cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/projects/art/wiki/Release_Notes_11400

3)
The BaBar track fitting code is now deployed as an external product named BTrk.
There is no longer a subdirectory named BaBar in the top level of Offline.
The BTrk code has no build-time dependence on the Mu2e Offline code.
A line was added to setup.sh to setup the correct version of BTrk.  All of
the lines in setup.sh that dealt with BaBar are gone.

4)
The FigureOfMerit package is still in Offline but it is not being built.
If there are no complaints it will go away completely in a future release
(of course you can always get it by checking out an older tag of the code).

5)
Because of 4), we no longer setup the splines package;
for the time being it is still distributed as part of artexternals.

6)
All of the compiler warnings have been fixed in the BTrk package.
All Mu2e code that uses BTrk headers has no compiler warnings from BTrk.
In an earlier commit, Pasha removed most of the compiler warnings from Stntuple.
We have only 34 to go.

5)
For people running offsite: for week or two the pullProducts scripts will not
download the BTrk ups product.  The temporary solution is described in:
 http://mu2e.fnal.gov/atwork/computing/download.shtml#v1_15_00
The long term solution is that pullProducts will pull everything we need in
one operation, including BTrk.

6)
If you are running a .fcl file that uses the BTrk code (either TrkPatRec or
CalPatRec) then you will need to add a new line to the services.user block:

   BTrkHelper : @local::BTrkHelperDefault

This tells art to create a service that pushes Mu2e specific information to the
BTrk code on every new run.  In the next release, v5_4_1, all of the fcl files
in Mu2e Offline will be updated to include this line.

7)
Most Mu2e members will not need to know how to build and install the BTrk code.
If you would like to see how this is done, see:
   http://mu2e.fnal.gov/atwork/computing/BTrk.shtml
This is linked from the gettingstarted page just below the instructions
on installing artexternals on a remote site.  There are two reasons you
might want to do this: the first is to build BTrk; the second is to see a
prototype for future changes to the build system.
