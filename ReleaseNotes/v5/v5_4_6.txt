   EventGenerator/fcl/prolog.fcl
     In the tdr era, the stopped muon file had to be staged in from bluearc.  It now
     lives in cvmfs so there is no need to stage it; this directory is the value of
     the env variable MU2E_DATA_PATH.

     Added fcl prolog definitions for the MU2E_DATA_PATH versions of the tdr and cd3
     stopped muon files, for both in-target (tgt) and out-of-target (oot) stops.
     Also defined a default which is set to cd3.

     Modified configurations that previously had the stopped muon file set to @nil to
     use the fcl prolog variable defined above.

   Reorganized the top level geometry files so that there is an organized structure
   to identify files designed to work on current era event-data and files designed
   to work on TDR era event data with modern code.  In order to maintain backwards
   compatibility an extra level of indirection has been introduced.  The other
   complication is the need to maintain compatibility with both G4_module.cc
   and Mu2eG4_module.cc - the difference is that the former looks for it's G4 options
   in the geometry file while the later finds its G4 options in the fcl file.

   - For jobs running Mu2eG4M_module, the top level geometry file remains:
        Mu2eG4/geom/geom_common.txt

     However this no longer contains real content.  Instead it includes
     the a named geometry file that represents the latest and greatest
     geometry.

   - For jobs running G4_module, the top level geometry file remains:
        Mu2eG4/test/geom_01.txt

     which simply includes two files
        Mu2eG4/geom/geom_common.txt
        Mu2eG4/geom/g4_userOptions.txt

     In this way both G4_module and Mu2eG4_module see the same geometry but
     get their other configuration differently.

   - The actual latest and greatest geometry is now in:
        Mu2eG4/geom/geom_common_cd3.txt
     This is included in geom_common.txt
     This file was previously called
        Mu2eG4/geom/geom_cd3.txt

   - There is a new file
        Mu2eG4/geom/geom_common_tdr.txt
     which contains the former content of
        Mu2eG4/geom/geom_common.txt

     It can be used to do modern tracker analysis on TDR era files.
     It will soon be updated to support Cal analysis on TDR era files.

   - There is a new file:
         Mu2eG4/test/geom_tdr.txt
     This is the analog of geom_01.txt but it includes
         Mu2eG4/geom/geom_common_tdr.txt
     instead of the cd3 geometry.  It can be used with G4_module.cc

   - Because geom_common.txt and geom_01.txt are still usable as is, this should
     not affect any downstream code.

7) September 18, 2015 ehrlich

   Added new CRV coincidence module.

6) September 14, 2015 gandr

   Move KalRepPtrCollection.hh and TrackSummaryRecoMap from
   KalmanTests to RecoDataProducts.


5) September 11, 2015 gandr

   Moved LinePointPCA.hh, LineSegmentPCA.hh, TwoLinePCA.hh from
   Mu2eUtilities to GeneralUtilities: their dependencies allow that,
   and a data product class depends on a PCA utility.

4) September 7, 2015 genser

   rewrote straw positioning test in StrawSD.cc;
   activated when ttracker.verbosityLevel>3
   added hit/straw position consistency test to
   ReadBack_module.cc using pset param: SHPositionTolerance

3) September 3, 2015 kutschke
   Add Mu2eG4/test/geom_ga04.txt to test the G404 field maps.

2) September 1, 2015 genser

   Renumbered tracker straws according to the note 888v7
   Improved the algorithms defining neighboring straws
   Reduced the thin tracker stiffening rings to the bottom half
