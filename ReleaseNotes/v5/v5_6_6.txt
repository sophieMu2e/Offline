           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v5_6_6

1) Feb 11, 2016
   Changes to the TTracker geometry to make it almost compliant with Mu2e-doc-888-v9,
   including the erratum.  The known exceptions are:
     a) The straws are about 55 microns closer, in z,  to the base plate
     b) Many details of the support structure have been approximated.

   Introduce 4 new TTracker geometry variables

      double ttracker.rInnermostWire       =   380.0;
      int    ttracker.layerZPattern        =     1;
      int    ttracker.innermostLayer       =     0;
      int    ttracker.panelZPattern        =     1;

   Also introduce a new support value for

      int    ttracker.rotationPattern      =     5;

   The rInnermostWire  parameter specifies the radius at the center of the innermost
   wire in each panel (presuming no gravitational sag). Previously this was a computed
   value that started from the inner edge of the envelope volume and had magic calculations
   using the obsolete manifolds from the MECO TTracker design.

   The layerZPattern variable may have the following values:
      0 - layer 0 is closest to the base plate and layer 1 is closest to the cover plate
          ( used in tdr and cd3 p1 designs)
      1 - layer 0 is closest to the cover plate and layer 1 is closest to the base plate
          ( used in the cd3 s4p2 and later designs ).

   The innermostLayer varible says whether layer 0 or layer 1 has its innermost straw at a
   radius of rInnermostWire.  All designs to date have layer 0 being the innermost layer
   (but the z sense of layer 0 changed for cd3 s4p2 - see the previous variable).

   The panelZPattern variable has the following meaning:
      0 - even numbered panels are on the upstream (-z) face and odd numbered panels
          are on the downstream face.  True for all planes.
          (used for tdr and cd3 p1 designs)
      1 - the upstream/downstream pattern follows that described in table 4 of the erratum
          to Mu2e-doc-888-v9.

   The new supported value for the rotation pattern is 5; this selects the rotation pattern
   given by table 4 of the erratum to Mu2e-doc-888-v9.

   The affected files are:

   Interpret the new geometry variables and apply to the geometry service model of the TTracker.
     - GeometryService/inc/TTrackerMaker.hh
     - GeometryService/src/TTrackerMaker.cc

   Updated geometry files:
    - Mu2eG4/geom/ttracker_cd3.txt
    - Mu2eG4/geom/ttracker_cd3_s4p2.txt
    - Mu2eG4/geom/ttracker_v3.txt

   Support panel 0 of plane 0 being either upstream or downstream; previous downstream was implied.
    - Mu2eG4/src/ConstructTTrackerTDR.cc

    With this changes I believe that it is possible remove all vestiges of the MECO style manifold
    objects and the trapezoid/box objects in the TTracker and TTrackerMaker code.
