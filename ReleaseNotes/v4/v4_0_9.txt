           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v4_0_9

    Updates for RPC studies to StoppedParticlesDumper and
    StoppedParticleReactionGun: when computing event weight, we need to
    account not just for the proper time of the stopped pion, but also
    include contributions from all its ancestors those decayse were
    turned off.  Since the ancestors could be of different particle
    types, a single proper time number does not carry enough
    information.  However if we add up proper times normalized to the
    appropriate lifetimes, we can compute the weight from that one
    number.

    Add free particle lifetimes to conditions service (PhysicsParams).
    They are needed because HepPDT values are not accurate, and als
    come in wrong units.

    This no longer needs network access to do its job.  It works in two steps:
     1) Does the checked out version match the requested on
     2) Have their been any changes since the checked out version
      BaBar/checkVersion.sh

    Make ttracker_v3.txt the default tracker
       Mu2eG4/test/geom_01.txt

    Update to the new design of main supports ( mu2e-doc-888-v6 ).
    This now works as a standalone include - it no longer needs to be include
    following v2
      Mu2eG4/test/ttracker_v3.txt

    The virtual detector TT_Mid has an outer radius that now depends on which
    geometry is selected. If the stabes are present it must be reduced to fit
    inside the staves.
       Mu2eG4/src/constructVirtualDetectors.cc

3)  January 6, 2014 kutschke
    Fix so that it is consistent with the geometry created by ConstructTTrackerTDR.cc
      Mu2eG4/src/StrawSD.cc

2)  January 6, 2014 kutschke
    Change from two expliclty named stiffening rings to a vector
    of stiffening rings.
      TTrackerGeom/src/SupportStructure.cc
      TTrackerGeom/inc/SupportStructure.hh


    Construct the new model of the stiffening rings:
      TTrackerGeom/src/TTrackerMaker.cc
      TTrackerGeom/inc/TTrackerMaker.hh

    New code for constructing the G4 representation of the TTracker.
    This is a major reorganization of the code formerly found in
    Mu2eG4/src/constructTTrackerv3Detailed.cc and a lot of new functionality
    was added.  The new code is:

       Mu2eG4/src/ConstructTTrackerTDR.cc
       Mu2eG4/inc/ConstructTTrackerTDR.hh

    This makes the following file obsolete - I will delete it
    as soon as we are sure at that it is safe.
       Mu2eG4/src/constructTTrackerv3Detailed.cc

    Modification to call the new code instead of the old code.
       Mu2eG4/src/constructTTrackerv3.cc
