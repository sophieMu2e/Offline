           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v4_1_7


12) April 10, 2014, genser
    Added a capability of "skipping" tracker devices/stations in
    Geant4 construction
    Controlled by vector<int> ttracker.nonExistingDevices = {};
    Added data members marking devices/straws as nonexistent and
    functions to query their status

      Mu2eG4/test/visqtGUI.mac: added yz view

    changes in the gap sizes and offsets of the CRV geometry
    Modified File:
      Mu2eG4/test/crv_counters.txt

10) April 7, 2014 brownd
    Update Compton removal parameters, training, weights, diagnostics and cuts.
    Modified files in TrkPatRec.

9) April 4, 2014, ehrlich
    Changed the overburden thickness from 3ft to 6ft.
    Modified file:
      Mu2eG4/test/geom_01.txt

8) April 2, 2014, genser
    Moved functionality of the sthktfO.C macro to StepsDiag.C and
    g4validate_01.C; upgraded g4validate_01.C functionality

      Mu2eG4/test/g4validate_01.C

7) April 1, 2014, brownd
    Added an MVA to pair straw hits into stereo hits.  This recovers
    efficiency lost due to non-Gaussian tails in the time division
    resolution seen in the more realistic hit simulation.
    Modified files:
      HitMakers/src/MakeStereoHits_module.cc

   Add proton pulse shapes, located in ConditionsService/data/, to
   conditions database, and remove explicit instances from
   ProtonPulseRandPDF.  This allows one to specify a desired proton
   shape in the loaded conditions*.txt file in the user's .fcl.

    Introduce StrawDigiMC, which summarizes the MC truth information that goes
    into making a StrawDigi.  In particular, this object remembers the MC time
    of the StepPoint which generated the hit (caused voltage to cross
    threshold), including time offsets due to protons on target and muon
    decay.  The associated collection is in parallel with
    the StrawDigi collection, and there's a separate collection of the same
    objects in paralle with the StrawHits.  Reimplement the MC truth testing
    in ReadKalfits to use the StrawDigiMC.

   Implement merging of MCTrajectories from previous simulations steps
   into the current collection in G4.

3) March 22, 2014, ehrlich
   Added an option for vertical production planes in the 
   cosmic ray event generator, and fixed some bugs.

    Added more configuration options to the CosmicRay event generator.

      EventGenerator/src/CosmicDYB.cc    
      EventGenerator/inc/CosmicDYB.hh

1) March 19, 2014, ehrlich
    Added a filter which filters out events which don't have a minimum number
    of StepPointMCs in the tracker
    Added Files:
      Filters/src/TrackerStepPointFilter_module.cc    
    Modified Files:
