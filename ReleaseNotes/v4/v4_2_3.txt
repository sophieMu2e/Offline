           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v4_2_3

2) May 28, 2014 brownd, kutschke, gandr

   Modified all .fcl files that contain the track reco chain to
   add a new module label FSHPreStereo, which is an instance of
   FlagStrawHits.  Those who have their own .fcl files are responsible
   for updating their own files:

   There are two steps: define the parameter set for the new module and add it to the path:

   physics.producers.FSHPreStereo: { module_type: FlagStrawHits
                                     StrawHitPositionCollectionLabel : ""
                                   }

   physics.p2: [ generate, g4run, genCounter,
                 dioMixer, protonMixer, neutronMixer, photonMixer, ootMixer, flashMixer,
                 protonTimeMap, muonTimeMap, makeSD, makeSH,
                 FSHPreStereo,
                 MakeStereoHits, FlagStrawHits, FlagBkgHits, TPRDownstreameMinus ]

   Updates to
      TrkPatRec/src/FlagStrawHits_module.cc
      HitMakers/src/MakeStereoHits_module.cc

   so that we can remove hits with large pulse height before forming
   stereo hits.  Needed to clean up the purity of stereo hits in a
   high occupancy environment.
