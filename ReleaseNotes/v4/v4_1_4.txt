   Updates to TDR jobs to
   - enable re-sampling out of target muon stops
   - more accurately handle stopped muon daughters (when using an upcoming G4 patch)

4) March 3, 2014 genser
   Added Shielding_MU2E02 physics list based on Shielding_MU2E01:
   replaced CHIPS with G4HyperonFTFPBuilder & G4FTFPAntiBarionBuilder

   Split simulation of straw electronics into 2 paths, one for
   threshold discrimination, the other for ADC.  Retuned parameters
   appropriately
1) February 28, 2014 knoepfel

   Added supports to inner proton absorber.  Need to fix the code to
   remove some hard-coded numbers, but at least the geometry should be
   more or less what we want.
