   Reimplemented placement of MSTM due to an overlap with
   VirtualDetectorId::DSNeutronShieldExit and to place it downstream
   of ExtNeutShielding; reimplemented placement of
   VirtualDetectorId::DSNeutronShieldExit and moved most of it to the
   geometry service; other small related changes
   Modified Files:
     ExternalNeutronShieldingGeom/inc/ExtNeutShieldCendBoxes.hh
       made centersOfBoxes return by (const) reference      
     GeometryService/src/VirtualDetectorMaker.cc
       moved (and modified) code related to VirtualDetectorId::DSNeutronShieldExit
       from constructVirtualDetectors.cc; reimplemented placement of 
       VirtualDetectorId::MSTM_DUpstream
     Mu2eG4/src/constructMSTM.cc
       used ExtNeutShieldCendBoxes positions to do placements
     Mu2eG4/src/constructVirtualDetectors.cc
       reimplemented placement of VirtualDetectorId::DSNeutronShieldExit
       plus small change to VirtualDetectorId::MSTM_DUpstream;
       added a way to do overlap check for vd only
     Mu2eG4/test/MSTM_v01.txt
       changed first element length to start if after ExtNeutShield
