           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v4_2_4

11) June 12, 2014 gandr

    TDR job configs to produce high statistic samples for muon decay in flight studies. 

10) June 10, 2014 gandr

    Persistent data products, makers, and supporting code for TrackSummary
    and track-truth matching.

9) June 10, 2014 gandr

   Extended FilterG4Out functionality:

   - produce a "remapping" transient product that can be used to
     update Ptr<SimParticle> elsewhere.

   - option to compress GenParticles

   - option to specify instance names of output SimParticle collections

   Added more elements of Muon Stopping Target Monitor (MSTM) plus
   minor code mods;
   Added MSTM_DUpstream virtual detector upstream of MSTM crystal
   detector;
   Moved creation of Mu2eEnvelope ahead of making of virtual
   detectors in GeometryService;

7) June 06, 2014 gandr

   Add photon spectrum from muminus capture on aluminum.
   This comes from John Quirk and Jim Miller (no docdb memo yet).

6) June 05, 2014 genser

   Added first implementation of Muon Stopping Target Monitor (MSTM);
   Reimplemented windows in constructExternalNeutronShielding using
   G4SubtractionSolid to avoid overlaps with MSTM; 
   Added MSTMCrystal detector

  Added MVA hit cleaning to time peak selection.  Tweaked Helix fit
  parameters.  Affects TrkPatRec

4) Jun 04, 2014 youzy
   Update TS pbar window in default geometry:
   a) Add a pbar window at TS1 collimator entrance;
   b) Add a pbar absorber with arc shape in TS1 collimator near exit;
   c) Change thickness of the old pbar window (disk) at TS3 center from
      120 microns to 200 microsn.

   Added code in the Sandbox to illustrate that ranged for loops
   indeed make a copy unless we explicity request a reference:
     for ( auto const & var : container ){ }

    Sandbox/test/rangedFor.fcl


2) Jun 02, 2014 murat

   Add a new module, TrackCaloMatching/src/TrackCaloMatching_module.cc

   The algorithm is cloned from TrackCaloMatching/src/CaloMatching_module.cc.
   However, the output is stored differently: for each track-cluster match 
   the calculcated match chi2 is also stored.

1) May 30, 2014 brownd

  Moved DeadStrawList from HitMakers to TrackerConditions to avoid a
  dependency problem.  Affects HitMakers TrackerConditions, and TrackerMC.
