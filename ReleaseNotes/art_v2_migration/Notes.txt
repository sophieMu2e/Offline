Steps taken to migrate from art v1_17_07 to art v2_04_00.

The order of the steps below is not chronological. For example
the changes to SConstruct were not done in a single step - they
were done as issues were discovered.  For clarity they are written
up as a single step.

The migration started with art v2_02_02.  Part way through
I switched to art v2_04_00.  Because the writeup is not
chronological I have not recorded which step was done with
which version of art.

1) Preparation
   I cloned that art repo and built it in verbose mode.
   I did this for both art v1_17_7 and art v2_04_00
   Noted the changs in the build flags and changes to
   how genreflex is used.

2)
From head of master:
 git checkout -b art_v2_migration

3) setup.sh:
Update ups product versions and qualifiers.

Add setups for xerces_c and tbb.  These used to come for free with art.
We now need to do them by hand.

The version of geant (v4_9_6_p04e) is a special build
just for us.  It is the same as v4_9_6_p04d but is built
with the e10 compiler, not e9:

4) SConstruct
 - add definitions of inc and lib for canvas and tbb
 - remove gccxml, cpp0x
 - modify build flags; see 1) above.
 - remove 'Cint' from the definition of rootlibs
 - Tweaks to the genreflex part of build; match what art
   does; see 1) above.

5)
Modify include directives for files that moved from
art to canvas.  This is done with a script provided by art:

cd to Offline top directory
setup -B art v2_04_00 -q+e10:+prof
$CANVAS_DIR/tools/canvas_refactor/update_for_art.sh

This script must be exec'ed, not sourced.

The script can be run more than once.

This script also makes changes to classes_def.xml files
for out-of-class enum-types.  All of our enum-types
are in-class.  So these are irrelevant for us.  The
action we do not need was append ::type in certain places.
If you encounter this in your own code, contact
Chris Green for details.
If we used cetbuildtools for our build system then
the above script would have also modified the link lists.
But we do not so we have an our own version in the next
step.

6)
Update link lists for the art->canvas evolution.
In most cases the art_ prefix is changed to canvas_.
In a few cases there is both a canvas_xx library
and an art_xx library.

This step was done using fix_link_lists, found in this directory.
When I used it, it was in the Offline top directory.
For each SConscript file in the hierarchy:

   perl -wapi\~ -f fix_link_lists <file>

This makes a copy of each file SConscript~ and then
modfies each SConscript in place.

The dictionary of changes to make was cribbed from:

  $CANVAS_DIR/tools/canvas_refactor/fix_cmake_art.pl

which is the code that updates link lists for

Other steps done by hand:
  - Remove all references to 'Reflex' from link lists
  - Add 'Core' to all link lists for dictionaries.
  - Some, but not all, main libraries required 'Core' in
    the link lists - I did not track down why.

7)
Hand edit all classes.h files
 - Remove all template instantions.  They are no longer needed.
 - If they are present, everything will still work but the build will be
   much slower and the dictionaries will be much bigger, both on disk and
   in memory.
 - Remove the CVS comments.
 - Remove all commented out lines.

8)
   DataProducts/src/classes_def.xml
   Remove these lines:
     - <class name="CLHEP::Hep2Vector"/>
     - <class name="CLHEP::Hep3Vector"/>
     - <class name="CLHEP::HepVector"/>
     - <class name="CLHEP::HepMatrix"/>
     - <class name="CLHEP::HepSymMatrix"/>
   These are defined to root in dictionaries maintained by art.

   Similarly for many classes declared in:
     MCDataProducts/src/classes_def.xml
     RecoDataProducts/src/classes_def.xml
     TrackCaloMatching/src/classes_def.xml


   One of the new behaviours is that if a class appears in two
   dictionaries then root will issue a run-time error and stop.

9)
There were some missing includes.  In the old art these includes
had come along with some other include but not in the new art.
So we need to provide them explicitly.  One example:

ExtinctionMonitorFNAL/Analyses/inc/EMFPatRecFakeHistograms.hh
needed to add:
#include "art/Framework/Principal/Handle.h

10)
  TrkDiag/test/KalFit.C
   - mods to work with root v6.
   - see comments in commit d41f7dc7 on Thu Sep 22 21:14:21 2016 -0500.
   - This was the rate limiting step; both root5 and root 6 delegate
     compilation to real compilers.  They behaved differently on code
     that had undefined behaviour.  When this was fixed the tests compared
     cleanly.

  TrkDiag/test/ce.C
   - mods to work with root v6.

11) Miscellanceous.
 a) Needed to add fully qualified std:: to cout, cerr and endl
    or add using namespace std; in a few places.
 b) Commentted out the for_each templates in
     - TrackerGeom/inc/Layer.hh
     - TrackerGeom/inc/Panel.hh
 c) Compiler caught some missing const and override keywords.
    Fixed these. I believe, but am not sure, that the new
    compiler flags caused these warnings.
    All were on obsolete code or on member functions with an
    empty body - so these errors did no harm in the past.
 d) Added missing BTrk libraries to link lists in
      RecoDataProducts/src/SConscript
 e) Make function signatures correct in: bin/browse.cint

12)
After the port was done I ran 200 events of Mu2eG4/fcl/g4test_03.fcl.
The two log files diff'ed cleanly.

13)
After the above ports were done I ran genReco.fcl for 2000 events.
The new code ran in 82% of the time taken by the old code:

art v2_04_00:
real	15m6.397s
user	14m44.422s
sys	0m6.492s

art v1_17_07:
real	18m16.983s
user	18m4.455s
sys	0m5.789s

The files sizes of the two .art files were almost identical
  - sub part per thousand difference


7) Ick. ./MCDataProducts/src/classes_def.xml has
   <class name="std::pair<CLHEP::Hep3Vector,CLHEP::HepLorentzVector>"/>
   This should almost certainly be struct with members position and momentum
   (actually 4 momentum).
   No change at this time - need to fix later.

11) Tried to remove mu2e_MCDataProducts from HelloWorld link list.
    It did not work because it is used for HelloProducer.  Maybe move this
    to Sandbox?
