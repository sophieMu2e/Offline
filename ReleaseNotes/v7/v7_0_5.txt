           Release notes for Mu2e Offline software, v7_0_5
           This new series includes breaking changes for MDC2018

10) Aug 10, 2018 brownd
   - Further consolidation and simplification of primary and mixing fcl
9) Aug 9, 2018 edmonds
   Completed digi compression
   - StepPOintMCCollections are no longer consolidated into one and are kept separate on the output
   - SimParticleCollections, GenParticleCollections and CaloShowerStepCollections are consolidated into one output collection
     -- compressSimParticleCollection was modified to deal with this
     	-- The old behaviour is still default
	--  To turn on the new behaviour pass in a SimParticleRemapping*
     -- SimParticles are no longer keyed to their internal ID in SimParticleCollection
   - calorimeterRO CaloShowerSteps are dropped from the event because of the Ptr bug (see DocDB-19477)
   - had to add a few modifier functions to CrvDigiMC, CaloShowerSim and CaloShowerStepRO so that I could remap their Ptrs

   Mu2eG4/src/Mu2eWorld.cc
     - After a calo geometry change from Bertrand the simulation stopped
       registering StepPointMCs in the calorimeter.
     - The reason was that the crystals in the front and back disks
       were different logical volumes with the same name.
     - Accessing the logical volumes by:
         G4LogicalVolumeStore::GetVolume(G4String const&)
       always returns the first of the two volumes with the same name.
     - So the sensitive detector handler was never registered with the
       crystals in the second disk.
     - Fixed by using an explicit loop over all logical volumes and
       checking the name to find both G4LogicalVolumes.
  The same inappropriate use of
     G4LogicalVolumeStore::GetVolume(G4String const&)
  was in place for every sensitive detector but it did not hurt us in
  other places because we did not have multiple logical volumes with the
  same name.  I fixed all of these instances.

   --ff-only merged branch trackerPatRec from Giani into MDC2018.

6) July 31, 2018 genser
   Corrected _visManager in Mu2eG4/src/Mu2eG4_module.cc which changed during MT merge

5) July 20, 2018 brownd
    Consolidate and cleanup fcl in prepreation for primary particle and mixing production
    Rename HitMakers to CommonMC as that is now its purpose
4) July 19, 2018 kutschke
   EventGenerator/fcl/prolog.fcl
     Commented out the definition of PrimaryProtonGunN
     in the table EventGenerator.producers that defines the full set of
     generators.  The corresponding library is not present in this commit so it
     generates an error at job startup when running EventGenerator/fcl/prolog.fcl.

3) July 18, 2018 kutschke
   Mu2eG4/fcl/g4test_03.fcl
     - Remove the individual configuration of proton time map and muon time map.
       Instead use the definitions in the prolog CommonDigiSim.  This now
       brings in the EventWindowMarker module; it's absence was the cause of the
       original error.

2) July 18, 2018 brownd, bonventre
    Update straw digitization.  This includes:
    - refinements to deal with boundary conditions near the microbunch wrapping
    - introduction of the event window marker and its use in digitization
    - clock distribution jitter
    - random threshold variation within hardware expectations
    - resolution of most of the FIXMEs
1) July 15, 2018 edmonds, brown
    Filtering and compression for beam flash hits in TrkCal and CRV
