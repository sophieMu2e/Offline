This note discusses the removal of StrawIndex and it's replacement
by StrawId everywhere.

As of May 30, 2018 there is one known outstanding issue.
I have not tested to see if the DeadStrawList correctly parses
the lists of dead planes and dead panels.

The remove of StrawIndex triggered the following additional changes:
 1) I reordered the dense array of all straws, held inside the
    TTracker object; none of our code was every supposed to
    depend on this order.  I did not find any that did.
      - old order: within a panel the straws were ordered by
                   one layer and then the other.
      - new order: straws are ordered in increasing radius
                   at their midpoint - ie alternating layers.
                   This is consistent with numbering the scheme
                   used by the tracker hardware project.

 2) Removed TrackerCalibrations everywhere. It is replaced
    by the many classes in TrackerConditions.

 3) Removed support for all variants of the tracker except
    the most recent.  I did not clean out old tracker
    geometry files - that will be another project.
    ( which will take some care because the new files are
      built as deltas to the old ones ... )

In addition I cleaned up some targets of opportunity:
 4) Removed cvs history comments
 5) Removed large bodies of commented out obsolete code.
 6) Removed unnecessary includes
 7) Rewrote some loops using ranged-for syntax.
 8) Moved some files to Legacy. These make use of StrawIndex
    and I did not have the energy to convert them.
    They will be useful for people who want to ressurect their
    functionality using StrawId.  In many cases these files
    need other maintenance to keep up with other evolutions
    in our code.

Thanks to Pasha for doing the work to remove StrawIndex
and TrackerCalibrations from the CalPatRec package.

Background:

In the old days there were two identifiers of straws:
  DataProducts/inc/StrawIndex.hh
  DataProducts/inc/StrawId.hh

StrawIndex - a dense identifier 0...(N-1)
             The order was arbitrary and no code should
             depend on the order

StrawId (old style) a tuple-of-ints identifier
   originally: plane, sector( aka panel), layer, straw
   later:      plane, panel, straw

StrawId (new style) a bit mapped uint16_t encoding:
        plane, panel, straw
        This is not a dense identifier but it is
        structured in a way that it convenient
        for writing FPGA code.

With this change, StrawIndex is gone entirely and
all access to straw information is via the new style
StrawId.

The key changes are:

 1) DataProducts/inc/StrawIndex.hh
    DataProducts/src/classes.h
    DataProducts/src/classes_def.xml
      - removed the .hh file and removed refernences to StrawIndex in the
        two genreflex files.

 2) GeometryService/src/TTrackerMaker.cc
     - change the order in which straws are inserted into the big array
     - Remove all use of StrawIndex
     - Lots of cleanup to remove support for obsolete trackers designs.

 3) TrackerGeom/inc/Straw.hh
    TrackerGeom/inc/Tracker.hh
    TrackerGeom/src/SConscript
    TrackerGeom/src/Straw.cc
    TTrackerGeom/inc/TTracker.hh
       - Remove all use of StrawIndex, which was only used as a key
         for accessors
       - Each accessor has been replaced by a matched accessor using
         a StrawId ( much of this was in place already ).

 4) DataProducts/src/StrawId.cc
    Reading a StrawId from a string now recognizes PlaneIds and PanelIds.
    If a, b, c are integers the formats are:
       StrawId: a_b_c
       PanelId: a_b
       PlaneId: a
    By convention a PanelId is equivalent to the StrawID for straw 0
    in that panel.  Similarly for a PlaneId - it is equivalent to the
    StrawId for straw 0 in panel 0 of that plane.

 5) Mu2eG4/src/StrawSD.cc
    From the G4 volume copy numbers, construct a StrawId and
    add this to the StepPointMC as it's volumeId.  Previously
    the code constructed a StrawIndex.

  6) Analyses/src/ConvElecHistory_module.cc
     Analyses/src/DIOElecHistory_module.cc
     Mu2eUtilities/inc/BkgElecUtilities.hh
     Mu2eUtilities/inc/ConvElecUtilities.hh
     Mu2eUtilities/src/BkgElecUtilities.cc
     Mu2eUtilities/src/ConvElecUtilities.cc
         - moved to Legacy

  7) Mu2eG4/inc/ConstructTTrackerTDR.hh
     Mu2eG4/inc/constructDummyTracker.hh
     Mu2eG4/src/ConstructTTrackerTDR.cc
     Mu2eG4/src/constructDummyTracker.cc
     Mu2eG4/src/constructTTrackerv3.cc
     Mu2eG4/src/constructTTrackerv3Detailed.cc
      - Removed support for obsolete tracker geometries.

  8) In many other files, find use of StrawIndex and
     change it to StrawId.  In most cases this was:
      a) diagnostic printout
      b) comparison to see if two objects refer to the same straw
      c) std::map<StrawIndex,T> changed to std::map<StrawId,T>
