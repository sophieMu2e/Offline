   - Updates to calorimeter digitization code.  In particular,
     CaloShowerStepROFromShowerStep must support multiple compressed

2) May 18, 2018 gandr

   - GenId cleanup: replace several GenId values for DIO with a single
     dioTail, to be used for signal-like high momentum tracks.

     Most of the "bulk hit" processes that are mixed into the "emtpy
     event" background frames, including the bulk DIO spectrum, use
     the StoppedParticleReactionGun generator ID.
