4) genser  1 October 2018

    updated pset level used when Birk's constants are changed
       Mu2eG4/src/Mu2eG4_module.cc
       Mu2eG4/src/setBirksConstant.cc
    added steppingVerbosityLevel
       Mu2eG4/fcl/prolog.fcl
       Mu2eG4/src/Mu2eG4_module.cc
    added modifyEMOption0 to enable changing standard EM MSC Models

3) hsong, edmonds TrkAna updates
   - TrackAnalysis module analyzes both negative and positive tracks as the default
   - TrkParticle can be changed in TrkDiag/fcl/prolog.fcl
   - TrackAnalysis now decides KalmanHitCollections for reconstruction and TrackCaloMatching using desired TrkParticle (previously electrons were hardcoded)
   - TrkAnaDigis ntuple output has 2 directories with a trkana TTree each. (Analysis scripts will have to be updated)
   - trkana TTree branch names were changed to generalize charge
   - TrackCaloMatching is now done for both electrons and positrons
   - TrkDiag/fcl/TrkAnaDigis.fcl and TrkDiag/fcl/TrkAnaDigisCRV.fcl were cleaned up and various renamings were moved to prologs
   - branch names changed to make it charge blind
   - added separate evtwts branch
   - also added PBIWeight module to convert ProtonBunchIntensity to an EventWeight
2) brownd 9/27/18
   - Fixed minor bug in StrawDigi creation
   - Added config for flat protons and calo-filtered flat gammas
   - Added mc filter for calo clusters
1) branch muminus_eplus : P.Murat
  1.1 bug fix in RMC/RPC internal conversion generation
      Bob's fix to RMC event weight
  1.2 all spectra parameterized as arrays of (x,y) pairs have x's corresponding to the bin centers
  1.3 fix shape of the RPC photon energy spectrum - wrong plot has been digitized and fit
  1.4 fix use of uninitialized memory in CalPatRec/src/DeltaFinder_module.cc
  1.5 initialize TrkStrawHit::hitRms with a small number to avoid assert's when printing
  1.6 add configs for proton reco to TrackCaloMatching and CalPatRec prolog files
