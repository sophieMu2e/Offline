This note describes the process of migrating our code from art v1_00_08 to art v1_03_08.
Below the ------ is an email from Chris Green that describes the process that we
followed.

A few clarifications:

1) The migration tools are only present in a checked out version of art; they are
   not present in an installed version of art.

2) Chris missed two steps.
   a) use <path-to-tools/migration>/fix-services.pl
   b) foreach *_service.cc :
      perl -wapi\~ <path-to-tools>/fix-signals.pl file_service.cc

4) Then we had to change by hand the items listed in v3_0_0.txt, item 1).

--------------------------------------------------


    Change the mu2e setup scripts to set up the correct packages.

    Verify the correct main packages are selected
    (gcc 4.7.1, art 1.03.08 -qmu2e:debug/prof,
     geant4 9.6p01 -qe2:debug/prof and
     ROOT 5.34/05 -qmue:debug/prof).

    Make sure the Babar code is activated for compilation and that compilation
    options are compatible.

    In a fresh checkout of art, cd to the tools/migration directory and run:

    ./update_sources.sh --no-fix-pset <mu2e-source-topdir>

    Verify the changes with cvs diff / svn diff on an individual basis for
sanity and then commit.

    cd to the mu2e source and execute the following scripts, verifying and
committing after each script:

        <path-to-tools/migration>/fix-auto-ptr

        <path-to-tools/migration>/fix-service-macros.pl

    You may need to add geant4/ to your existing -I${GEANT4_INC} directive.
    Compile and tweak until everything works.

Notes:

    I would recommend oink for the work because it's practically unused and
one can run a 16-way build (yes, I know there are only 8 cores).
    For the first build I would recommend full-parallel with -i option followed
by a non-parallel with -i to a log file. Work through the log file fixing
problems as they arise and then repeat the procedure.
See ~greenc/work/cet-is/sources/cet-chg/scripts/build-mu2e for an example
build command satisfying these requirements. This should minimize the
cycle-time.
